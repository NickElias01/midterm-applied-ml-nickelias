Midterm project for NWMSU CSIS 44688-80
# Mushroom Classification Project  

## Overview  
This project analyzes the **UCI Machine Learning Repository's Mushroom Dataset** to classify mushrooms as **edible or poisonous** using machine learning techniques. The analysis highlights the importance of **feature selection** and **model validation** in classification tasks.  

## Key Features  
- **Binary classification** (edible vs. poisonous mushrooms)  
- **Feature analysis and selection**  
- **Random Forest and Decision Tree models**  
- **Cross-validation and performance metrics**  
- **One-hot encoding implementation**  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **scikit-learn**  
- **pandas**  
- **matplotlib**  
- **seaborn**  

## Key Findings  
- Achieved initial **100% accuracy** with strong predictors  
- Cross-validation scores ranged from **81.59% to 100%**  
- Weaker features resulted in **86.83% accuracy**  
- **Feature selection** dramatically impacts model performance  

## Important Note  
This analysis is for **educational purposes only**. Never rely solely on machine learning models for mushroom identification in real-world scenarios.
